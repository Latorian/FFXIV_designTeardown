# FFXIV_designTeardown
The goal for this exercise is to start training yourself to think in terms of visual hierarchy, typography and design principles.
To try something different in CSS, I decided to deconstruct the FFXIV Shadowbringer's page. My inspiration for this project was 
From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

I used a grayscale map to recreate the visual heirarchy of the page and try to see where my eyes were drawn to most.

This was also an opportunity to mess around with Bulma.io's styling and layouts tools.
